# Prime Number Checker

This is a Java program that determines whether a given number is prime or composite. It also provides the number of iterations required to find the factors of composite numbers.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your computer.
2. Download the `PrimeNumberChecker.java` file.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `PrimeNumberChecker.java` file.
4. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac PrimeNumberChecker.java`
5. Run the program using the command: `java PrimeNumberChecker`
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a number and view the results.
7. To exit the program, enter `0` when prompted for a number.

## Program Details

The program implements two methods to check if a number is prime or composite:

1. **Method I**: This method uses the regular calculation method. It divides every positive number between 2 and the given value (exclusive) to check for factors. The number of iterations required to find the factors is displayed.

2. **Method II**: This method uses the algorithm mentioned in the class. It iterates through the algorithm steps to determine if the number is prime or composite. However, this method is not implemented in the current program.

## Example

Here's an example program execution:
Please enter a number (enter 0 to exit): 12
12 is a composite number and factors are: 2 3 4 6
Number of iterations with Method I: 10
Number of iterations with Method II: 1
